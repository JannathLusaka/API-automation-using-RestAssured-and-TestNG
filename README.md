# About this "API Automation using RestAssured and TestNG" project:
In this project, I have created a Postman collection by inspecting the API requests from the network tab
From the website:  https://dailyfinance.roadtocareer.net/
The Postman collection contains APIs of the following features: 
a. Register a new user
b. Login by admin
c. Get user list
d. search the new user by user id
e. edit the user info
f. Login by any user
g. Get item list
h. Add any item
i. Edit any item name
j. Delete any item from the item list
And some negative test cases.
After creating I have automated the API collection using RestAssured. I used TestNG as a testing framework 
and Finally generated an Allure Report.
